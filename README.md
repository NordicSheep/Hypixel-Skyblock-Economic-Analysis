# üìä Hypixel Bazaar Flipping Performance Tracker

A modular, data-accurate dashboard to track and analyze Bazaar and Auction flipping in Hypixel SkyBlock.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

- Track profits and ROI using FIFO cost basis
- Analyze trends across item types, tiers, and market tags
- Visualize open positions, breakeven points, and mayor-based opportunities
- Enable configurable fee assumptions for Bazaar and Auction
- Support dynamic dashboard layout and refresh controls
- Prepare for long-term ML-based price trend prediction

## üß© Core Features

### ‚úÖ Trade Logging
- Manual buy/sell trade entry
- FIFO profit matching
- Minimum Bazaar fee (1.25%) applied on sell offers
- Configurable fee logic

### ‚úÖ Bazaar Snapshot Logger
- Logs market prices once per day at **7 PM**
- Fields: buy/sell prices, volume, timestamp
- Archived monthly (older than 6 months) into `bazaar_snapshots_archive`

### ‚úÖ Profit Calculation Engine
- FIFO trade matching
- Realized profit, cost basis, and TWR tracking
- Break-even logic for open positions

### ‚úÖ Analytics & Performance Metrics

#### Core Reports
- **Realized Profit**
- **Time-Weighted Return (TWR)**  
  _Assumes lowest Bazaar fee ‚Äî configurable override supported_

- **Grouped Performance Report**  
  Aggregate ROI by:
  - Category (e.g., Farming, Mining)
  - Tier (Common, Epic, etc.)
  - Economy Tag (Dungeon, Essence, etc.)

- **Open Positions Report**
  - Quantity, cost basis, live bid/ask
  - Required break-even unit price
  - Visual gap indicator between cost, breakeven, and current

- **Price Manipulation Flag**
  - Detects items with abnormally high bid-ask spreads
  - Useful for flagging potential market manipulation

---

## üî• Mayor Heatmap Module
- Tracks item price behavior before/after mayor elections
- Identifies "mayor-sensitive" items based on historical performance
- Visualized as sortable table/heatmap

---

## üéØ Auction IRR Module (Separate)
- Calculates Internal Rate of Return on auction flips
- Assumes:
  - 1% sale fee
  - 2% listing fee  
  _Configurable for future fee changes_

- Tracks:
  - Time held
  - Coins in/out
  - Final IRR per flip

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)
- Built with **React + Tailwind**
- Layout grid: powered by `react-grid-layout`
- Features:
  - Drag & resize modules
  - Save layout preferences
  - Toggle auto-refresh (5 min intervals)
  - Manually enable/disable data updates

---

## üå± Optimistic Features (Stretch Goals)

### I. Volatility Classification  
Flag items with unstable spread/price patterns

### II. Liquidity Scoring  
Rank items by average turnover speed

### III. Historical Profit Consistency  
Score items by % of profitable weeks or time intervals

### IV. Mayor Sensitivity Index  
Assign sensitivity scores based on item response to specific mayors

### V. Time-in-Trade Analysis  
Track and visualize average hold durations by item or tag

---

## üîÆ Long-Term Stretch Goal: ML-Based Price Prediction

Implement machine learning models to:
- Predict item-specific Bazaar price trends
- Forecast ROI for different items using:
  - Historical snapshots
  - Grouped performance patterns
  - Mayor trends

### Includes Mayoral Sequence Modeling:
- Analyze how **specific sequences of mayors** affect item prices
- For example: Aatrox ‚Üí Paul may cause different results than Aatrox ‚Üí Diana
- Uses sequential/temporal models like LSTM or Prophet
